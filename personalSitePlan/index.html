However, it started as a small, experimental network in the late 1960s, created to solve a problem: how to enable computers to communicate with one another even if some connections failed. Born from research and defense needs during the Cold War, early experiments led to the creation of ARPANET, a project funded by the U.S. government to connect researchers and share information.
