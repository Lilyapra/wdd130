        The internet, as we know it today, is an essential part of daily life, connecting people, ideas, and information across the globe. However, it started as a small, experimental network in the late 1960s, created to solve a problem: how to enable computers to communicate with one another even if some connections failed. Born from research and defense needs during the Cold War, early experiments led to the creation of ARPANET, a project funded by the U.S. government to connect researchers and share information.

        Over the next few decades, this small network grew, evolving into a worldwide system that would forever change how we interact, learn, and work. From the invention of packet-switching to the creation of the World Wide Web, the internet’s story is one of technological innovation and collaboration. This timeline explores the key milestones that turned a simple idea into one of humanity’s most transformative achievements.
